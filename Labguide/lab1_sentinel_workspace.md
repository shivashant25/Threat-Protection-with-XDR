# Lab 01 - Review and explore sentinel workspace

## Lab scenario

In this lab, participants will explore a pre-configured Azure Sentinel workspace, investigating security incidents, configuring automated responses, and analyzing data to strengthen threat detection and response capabilities within the Azure environment.

## Lab objectives
 In this lab, you will perform the following:
 - Task 1: Log in to Azure Portal and verify the pre-deployed resources
 - Task 2: Explore Sentinel workspace
 - Task 3: Onboard a Device

### Exercise 1: Exploring a Pre-Created Azure Sentinel Workspace

### Task 1: Log in to Azure Portal and verify the pre-deployed resources.

1. In the virtual machine (VM) on the left, click on the Azure Portal as shown below.

### Task 3: Onboard a Device

In this task, you will onboard a device to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using an onboarding script.

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal in your browser, start the Microsoft Edge browser go to (https://security.microsoft.com) and log in with the **Tenant Email** credentials.

1. Select **Settings** from the left menu bar, then from the Settings page select **Endpoints**.

1. Select **Onboarding** in the Device Management section.

    >**Note:** You can also perform device onboarding from the **Assets** section of the left menu bar. Expand Assets and select Devices. On the Device Inventory page, with Computers & Mobile selected, scroll down to **Onboard devices.** This takes you to the **Settings > Endpoints** page.

1. In the "1. Onboard a device" area make sure "Local Script (for up to 10 devices)" is displayed in the Deployment method drop-down and select the **Download onboarding package** button. 

1. Under the *Downloads* pop-up, highlight the "WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip" file with your mouse and select the folder icon **Show in folder**. **Hint:** In case you don't see it, the file should be in the c:\users\admin\downloads directory.

1. Right-click the downloaded zip file and select **Extract All...**, make sure that **Show extracted files when complete** is checked and select **Extract**.

1. Right-click on the extracted file "WindowsDefenderATPLocalOnboardingScript.cmd" and select **Properties**. Select the **Unblock** checkbox in the bottom right of the Properties windows and select **OK**.

1. Right-click on the extracted file **WindowsDefenderATPLocalOnboardingScript.cmd** again and choose **Run as Administrator**.  **Hint:** If you encounter the Windows SmartScreen window, select on **More info**, and choose **Run anyway**. 
    
1. When the "User Account Control" window is shown, select **Yes** to allow the script to run and answer **Y** to the question presented by the script and press **Enter**. When complete you should see a message in the command screen that says *Successfully onboarded machine to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint*.

1. Back in the Onboarding page from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, under the section "2. Run a detection test", copy the detection test script by selecting the **Copy** button.  

1. In the windows search bar of the virtual machine, type **CMD** and choose **Run as Administrator** on the right pane for the Command Prompt app.
